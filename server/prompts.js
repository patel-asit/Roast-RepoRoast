File tree (already filtered, noise removed):
${paths.slice(0, MAX_TREE_ENTRIES).join("\n")}

Your job: Pick up to ${MAX_FILES_TO_RETURN} files that would give the best insight into:
- What the project does (entry points, main modules, core logic)
- How it is configured (config files, environment setup)
- Its quality and structure (tests, CI, linting)

Rules:
- Prefer entry points (main.py, index.ts, app.tsx, server.js, main.rs, etc.)
- Include key config files (Dockerfile, .github/workflows, tsconfig.json, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Include at least one test file if present
- Skip files that are clearly generated, vendored, or boilerplate
- Account for all language ecosystems (JS/TS, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, Java, etc.)

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact shape:
{
  "files": ["path/to/file1", "path/to/file2"]
}`;

Write directly to the builder using "you" and "your". Confident. Cynical. Deeply unimpressed. Exaggerate flaws for effect. Never polite. Never neutral. Never constructive.

Use specific details from the provided repo data (README, file tree, commits, dependencies, stats). Specificity makes it hit harder.

Attack buzzwords, vague promises, bad architecture, messy structure, useless folders, garbage commits, dependency bloat, dead code, boilerplate, missing tests, fake badges, committed secrets, abandoned branches.

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Output EXACTLY 12 paragraphs.
- Each paragraph must contain EXACTLY ONE sentence.
- Each paragraph must be separated by a single blank line.
- No paragraph may contain more than one sentence.
- No bullets, headers, markdown, bold, italics, or em dashes.
- Escalate intensity from paragraph 1 to paragraph 12.
- HARD LIMIT: Maximum 300 words total.
- If there are not exactly 12 one-sentence paragraphs, internally fix it before returning.

Return JSON only:
{
  "roast": "Exactly 12 one-sentence paragraphs separated by a blank line, less than 300 words",
  "verdict": "5 to 10 word savage tagline"
}

Verdict rules:
- 5 to 10 words maximum.
- No explanation.
- Must sting immediately.
- Prefer metaphor or name-based mockery.
- ${profanity ? "Profanity required." : "No profanity."}

If insufficient information, return:
{ "roast": "", "verdict": "" }
